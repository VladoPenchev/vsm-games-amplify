# Step Complete Command

**Usage:** `/step-complete <step-number>`

**Examples:** 
- `/step-complete 1.2`
- `/step-complete 2.1` 

## Description

Completes a development step by creating **two complementary documents**:
1. **Handoff Brief** - Updates CLAUDE.md for fresh session continuity
2. **Detailed Documentation** - Creates comprehensive step record in docs/

This dual approach ensures both immediate productivity and long-term knowledge retention.

## What This Command Does

### 1. Updates Handoff Brief (CLAUDE.md)
Creates/updates the "🚀 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS" section with:

- **📊 Current State:** What's implemented and working right now
- **🎯 Next Step:** Specific objectives for next step (auto-detected from specs)
- **⚡ Quick Test:** Commands to verify current functionality
- **⚠️ Critical Notes:** Key gotchas and shortcuts discovered
- **📁 Ready to Modify:** Files that will likely need changes next

*Note: Creates CLAUDE.md if it doesn't exist (first run)*

### 2. Creates Detailed Step Documentation
Generates `docs/development-steps/step-X.X-<name>.md` with:

- **Technical Implementation:** Complete code changes and patterns
- **Issues & Solutions:** Full problem/debugging documentation  
- **Lessons Learned:** Deep insights for future troubleshooting
- **Architecture Decisions:** Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Reference Commands:** Useful commands and techniques discovered

### 3. Updates README.md (When Appropriate)
Intelligently updates project README to reflect current capabilities:

- **Project Description:** Updates from "starter template" to current reality
- **Feature List:** Shows implemented games and functionality
- **Development Status:** Current phase/step progress
- **Usage Instructions:** How to run and test current features
- **Architecture Overview:** High-level technical summary

## Command Execution Flow

When you run `/step-complete 1.2`:

1. **Analyze Current State:**
   - Review recent commits and changes
   - Identify what's currently functional
   - Assess user-facing feature changes

2. **Auto-Detect Next Step:**
   - Read project spec to determine logical next step
   - Map current step to development roadmap
   - Generate specific next step objectives

3. **Update/Create Handoff Brief (CLAUDE.md):**
   - Create CLAUDE.md if first run
   - Update "🚀 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS" section
   - Use consistent format that prime command expects
   - Include immediate test/verification steps

4. **Create Step Documentation:**
   - Generate detailed technical documentation
   - Capture debugging techniques and solutions
   - Document lessons learned and best practices

5. **Evaluate README Update Need:**
   - **Major Features Added:** Always update (new games, core functionality)
   - **Infrastructure Changes:** Update for significant architecture changes
   - **Bug Fixes:** Usually skip README updates
   - **Ask When Uncertain:** Prompt for README update decision

6. **Update README (If Needed):**
   - Replace outdated starter template language
   - List current implemented features
   - Update installation/usage instructions
   - Show development progress status

7. **Commit All Documents:**
   - Add to version control with descriptive messages
   - Ensure knowledge persistence across sessions
