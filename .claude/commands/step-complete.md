# Step Complete Command

**Usage:** `/step-complete <step-number>`

**Examples:** 
- `/step-complete 1.2`
- `/step-complete 2.1` 

## Description

Completes a development step by creating **three essential documents**:
1. **Handoff Brief** - Updates CLAUDE.md for fresh session continuity
2. **Detailed Documentation** - Creates comprehensive step record in docs/
3. **README Updates** - ALWAYS updates README.md to reflect current functionality

This comprehensive approach ensures immediate productivity, long-term knowledge retention, and accurate project documentation.

## What This Command Does

### 1. Updates Handoff Brief (CLAUDE.md)
Creates/updates the "🚀 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS" section with:

- **📊 Current State:** What's implemented and working right now
- **🎯 Next Step:** Specific objectives for next step (auto-detected from specs)
- **⚡ Quick Test:** Commands to verify current functionality
- **⚠️ Critical Notes:** Key gotchas and shortcuts discovered
- **📁 Ready to Modify:** Files that will likely need changes next

*Note: Creates CLAUDE.md if it doesn't exist (first run)*

### 2. Creates Detailed Step Documentation
Generates `docs/development-steps/step-X.X-<name>.md` with:

- **Technical Implementation:** Complete code changes and patterns
- **Issues & Solutions:** Full problem/debugging documentation  
- **Lessons Learned:** Deep insights for future troubleshooting
- **Architecture Decisions:** Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Reference Commands:** Useful commands and techniques discovered

### 3. Auto-Updates README.md (MANDATORY)
ALWAYS updates project README for every step completion:

- **Development Status:** Mark current step complete, update dates (MANDATORY)
- **Feature List:** Update to reflect newly implemented functionality
- **Usage Instructions:** Refresh user flow to match current capabilities  
- **Production URLs:** Add live demo links when deployment steps complete
- **Project Description:** Keep current with implemented reality (no "in development" for working features)

## Command Execution Flow

When you run `/step-complete 1.2`:

1. **Analyze Current State:**
   - Review recent commits and changes
   - Identify what's currently functional
   - Assess user-facing feature changes

2. **Auto-Detect Next Step:**
   - Read project spec to determine logical next step
   - Map current step to development roadmap
   - Generate specific next step objectives

3. **Update/Create Handoff Brief (CLAUDE.md):**
   - Create CLAUDE.md if first run
   - Update "🚀 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS" section
   - Use consistent format that prime command expects
   - Include immediate test/verification steps

4. **Create Step Documentation:**
   - Generate detailed technical documentation
   - Capture debugging techniques and solutions
   - Document lessons learned and best practices

5. **Auto-Update README.md:**
   - **ALWAYS update for Major Features** (authentication, new games, core functionality)
   - **ALWAYS update for Infrastructure Changes** (deployment, architecture changes)
   - **ALWAYS update Development Status** (mark current step complete, update dates)
   - **NEVER skip README updates** for step completions - user shouldn't need to remind you
   - **Update immediately without asking** - README should reflect current reality

6. **README Update Actions (Automatic):**
   - Mark current step as complete with ✅ in Development Status
   - Update "Last Updated" date and step number
   - Refresh user flow instructions to match current functionality
   - Add production URL if deployment step completed
   - Update feature descriptions to match implemented state

7. **Commit All Documents:**
   - CLAUDE.md handoff brief
   - docs/development-steps/step-X.X-name.md detailed documentation
   - README.md updates (ALWAYS included)
   - Add to version control with descriptive messages
   - Ensure knowledge persistence across sessions
